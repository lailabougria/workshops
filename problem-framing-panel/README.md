# How to frame problems towards better solutions

## Abstract

Software solutions can help organisations streamline operations, improve efficiency and even drive innovation, making software part of many organisations' strategy. A substantial amount of time, effort and resources are invested in building these tools, but unfortunately, a significant number of these efforts fail. One core factor in the success of these efforts, is the ability of stakeholders and engineering teams to achieve a shared understanding of the problem they are addressing. Sounds obvious, right?! However, this is often the key point where most misalignment occurs (and goes unnoticed). It's easy to fall into the trap of miscommunicating the intent or framing problems as solutions which can severly hinder a team's ability to approach problems with an open mind and free of bias.

During this panel, I will start the discussion by presenting a real-world use case that illustrates the challenges of problem framing and their direct impact on the solutions developed by engineering teams. This case study will provide the basis for an insightful dialogue amongs stakeholders from diverse sectors to delve deeper into these challenges. Together, we'll explore and discuss techniques that help prevent misalignment, and instead, boost effective collaboration and problem framing, guiding us toward more successful and innovative solutions, right from the start.
