# How to frame problems towards better solutions

## Abstract

Software solutions can help organizations streamline operations, improve efficiency, and help drive innovation, making software part of many organizations' strategies. A substantial amount of time, effort, and resources are invested in building these tools, but unfortunately, a significant number of these efforts fail. One core factor in these efforts' success is the ability of stakeholders and engineering teams to achieve a shared understanding of the problem they are addressing. Sounds obvious, right?! However, this is often the key point where most misalignment occurs (and goes unnoticed). It's easy to fall into the trap of miscommunicating the intent or framing problems as solutions, which can severely hinder a team's ability to approach problems with an open mind and free of bias.

During this panel, I will start the discussion by presenting a real-world use case that illustrates the challenges of problem framing and their direct impact on the solutions developed by engineering teams. This case study will provide the basis for an insightful dialogue among stakeholders from diverse sectors to delve deeper into these challenges. Together, we'll explore and discuss techniques that help prevent misalignment and boost effective collaboration and problem-framing, guiding us toward more successful and innovative solutions right from the start.
