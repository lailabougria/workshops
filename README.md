# Workshops

Hi there! If you're visiting, that means you may be interested in attending one of my workshops, or have previously attended one.

Here, you'll find detailed information about the workshops I offer, including any material used during the workshop, such as slides or code samples, as well as any additional resources that may be of interest if you'd like to expand your knowledge on the topic.

## How to navigate this repo

Each workshop is listed in its own folder, and contains an abstract and, in some cases, workshop material.

## Questions?
