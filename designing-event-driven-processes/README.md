# Beyond basic messaging: Designing long-running processes

## Abstract

Messaging in distributed systems offers a range of valuable benefits: it enables the design of decoupled components, where each component can evolve and scale independently. In addition to improving the system’s fault tolerance, it opens the door to building self-healing systems. One benefit that doesn’t usually appear in the Googleable list of benefits is one of the most powerful: supporting real-life, long-running business processes and making the system mirror real-world business use cases. And that’s precisely the focus of this workshop.

If you’ve been exposed to the basic building blocks of messaging and want to understand how to design, build, and test long-running processes in message-based distributed systems, this workshop is for you.

Throughout this workshop, you’ll learn:

- (Re)Define what long-running processes are and how to identify them in your domain
- Effective techniques to help design complex business processes
- What orchestration and choreography are, but more importantly, when and why to use each pattern
- How to deal with actions that occur at different points in time
- How to deal with out-of-order events seamlessly
- How to test long-running processes and troubleshoot issues where it matters most: in production!

To get the most out of this workshop, basic messaging knowledge is expected due to the limited time available. This includes understanding message brokers (like Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, or other broker technologies) and messaging patterns like Request-Reply and Publish-Subscribe. 

Throughout this workshop, we'll dive into different design exercises in small groups, where you'll mostly need pen and paper. Code examples and exercises will be provided as additional material to showcase the use cases discussed during the workshop.

Join me and unlock the secrets of messaging's real-world superpowers!
