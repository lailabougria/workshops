### ViewModel composition

ViewModel composition is a technique that Udi Dahan discusses in his [Advanced Distributed System Design course](https://particular.net/adsd).
Based on those insights, Mauro Servienti took the concept and turned into a series on his blog, covering all angles of this method to help you design a composed UI that respects your service boundaries.

An introductory article is available on [Particular Software's blog](https://particular.net/blog/secret-of-better-ui-composition).
The full series is available on [Mauro's blog](https://milestone.topics.it/series/view-model-composition.html).
