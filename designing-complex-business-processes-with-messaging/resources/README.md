# Resources

Here you can find a list of resources to refresh or further your understanding of these topics. I try to keep this list up to date with new resources I come across, if you can think of valuable additions, feel free to contribute!

The resources are divided into separate categories, based on the workshop format:

- [Service boundaries](service-boundaries.md)
- [Orchestration versus Choreography](orchestration-vs-choreography.md)
- [Time and order](time-and-order.md)
- [Testing](testing.md)
- [Observability](observability.md)
